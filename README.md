Nowadays, the overexploting of the non renewables resources are leading Mexico to take energetic alternatives for the lack of fosil fuels and global climate consecuenses.

Mexico is a country with great potential in geothermal energy, solar, eolic and hydraulic energy, but only 22% of national eletricity comes from renewable resources.
That´s why we made an analysis of every Mexico state to compare its energetic and economic potential to create alternatives in the energetic field.
